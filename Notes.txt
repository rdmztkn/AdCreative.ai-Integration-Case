I've added 'DisributedItemIntegrationService' to demonstrate how to handle the 
integration of the distributed service calls. Thus, in program.cs, you can switch between your implementation 
and the distributed one. 

As this was a Console app, I didn't use any DI framework, but I would have used if I thought it was necessary.

I also assume that the life time of 'DisributedItemIntegrationService' is Singleton so I created the Redis
connection in the constructor.
